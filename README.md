## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Useful resources

- [CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - This helped me reset the CSS styling browsers add by default with a bit of customization by Josh Comeau. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
